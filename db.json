As she is taking it home, it keeps changing.\n\nHowever, her enthusiasm refuses to fade away (disappear or faint slowly).\n\nWhat Is Great About It: The old lady in this story is one of the most cheerful characters anyone can encounter in English fiction.\n\nHer positive disposition (personality) tries to make every negative situation seem like a gift, and she helps us look at luck as a matter of our view rather than events.",
